# Sunbase-Work
all the files are in the master branch. the DoTween scene is for the API integration and the CircleSpawner scene is for task 2. i was able to do the circle spawning task easily but the API integration was really tough for me and i wasn't able to implement it fully. I would like to thank Sunbase for the opportunity to try this assignment and give it a shot. Thank you :)
